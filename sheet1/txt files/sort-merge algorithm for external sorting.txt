//The sort-merge algorithm for external sorting:

       j<--b;    {size of the file in blocks}
       k<--nB; {size of buffer in blocks}
       m<--ciel(j/k);

while (i<=m)
       do{
            read next k blocks of the file into the buffer or if there are less than k blocks                             remaining, then read in the remaining blocks;
            sort the records in the buffer and write as a temporary subfile;
            i<--i+1;
           }

                            read next k-1 subfiles or remaining subfiles(from previous pass) one block                              at a time; merge and write as new subfile one block at a time;
                            n<--n+1;
